Hello guys,

This is a template for the project.
Have a look to get familiar with the working environment of React.

a few steps - 

1.Check for python,npm,pip installations on your machine, if not download them

2.Navigate to the fullstack_template/static dir and execute "npm install" - this hopefully should install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json file

3.Inside the static dir, run "npm run watch"

if you want to get a glimpse of how backend will be set try this
4.Create virtual environment
5.install flask by "pip3 install flask"
6.go to server directory and execute "python server.py"
